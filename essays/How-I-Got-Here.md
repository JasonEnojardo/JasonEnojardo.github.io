## How I got Here

  Probably like most other students choosing to get their degrees in Computer Engineering or Computer Science started out playing video games. I for one started to find my passion for the tech industry this way. Somewhere along the way in hours of playing whatever it is Iâ€™m hooked on I decided that I wanted to go to school and learn to program and learn how to build devices like game consoles or other types of circuits. I got interested in how our electronics operated, so I asked google questions like, how do touchscreens work on smartphones, how do you develop a video game, and what are circuits made from. I knew I wanted to do something where I can say I worked on something that benefits or helps someone in a positive way. I also looked up how much do you get paid to develop and design the products we use every day. So that's how I choose to get a degree in computer engineering.

  So, computer engineering is half electrical engineering and computer science. So, to stick to the computer science side, what interest me most about software engineering is that I could make something that is helpful to others. Another thing is the process of going through the steps in designing, developing, testing, and maintaining/improving a program sounds fun and presents challenges that improves me as a developer/engineer.

## How I see my Future

  In the future I hope to develop my skills in programming by writing code in the best efficient way. I also hope to continue improving my communication skills with teammates/co-workers and ask the right questions when I don't know something. I also how to improve my knowledge with what programming languages I should be using based on the application I'm trying to work on and become p[proficient in the languages I already know.
