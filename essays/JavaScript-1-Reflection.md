Because he used typeof on a penny and got a "string" instead of a "number."

## Javascript

  Prior to today I've learned about and used the programming languages C, C++, Python, Kotlin, Batch File in DOS, and Powershell. This is the first time I've ever learned and used the JavaScript programming language and so far, I've enjoyed using it because it's not heavy on syntax like in C so it's simpler to use and write programs in. Also comparing programs written in C and C++, to write a program that does something similar in JavaScript, it requires less code, and you donâ€™t must think about things like dynamically allocating memory and using pointers because JavaScript takes care of that for you. But it still retains a lot of things I like about C and C++ for example it shares the same syntax used in C such as having to use "{}" to block code versus in Python you use indentations. I think that's a good attribute if you have a background where your first programming language is C or C++. Now with the different amount of programming languages I've experienced using, I think JavaScript is a good programming language to learn about because from the perspective of a software engineer it's advantageous for you to know more than one language just so that you can see how you can make your code in one language compatible for use in another language. For example, if you're a back-end engineer creating APIs in Python you would want to know how good your API is so you should learn JavaScript as this is more of a front-end language used to create interfaces using the back-ends API. This way as a back-end engineer you can improve your code to meet the needs of those in the front-end.
