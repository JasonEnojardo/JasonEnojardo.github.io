## What About Asking Smart Questions?

  In this essay I will compare questions asked in a smart manner versus one asked in a not so smart manner and we'll see the types of responses each of the questions yield. To start off let's define what's the smart way to ask a question that will most likely yield a helpful response and not get you criticized. The first thing you should do when you have a problem is to try and find the solution yourself by searching the web, such as using search engines like google, to find websites, forums, or other FAQ's [1]. It's most likely you are not the only one who has come across the issue you're having. So most likely someone else has already posted a similar question to the one you're thinking of in a forum or FAQ and has gotten pointers or the answer you're looking for. By doing this you're taking the time to narrow down your issue and get closer to finding a solution and even if you don't this will help you formulate a more concise question that will show who you're asking that you've already taken the time to try and develop a solution yourself and are willing to help yourself [1]. you also want to make sure you describe the issue you’re having like how the issue is occurring and inform the steps you've already taken to try and solve your problem [1]. You also want to describe the environment the issue is occurring in that way others can narrow down solutions in their response quicker and not have to ask what version of the application the issue you're experiencing on [1]. Also make sure to write clearly and without grammatical errors [1]. As we might expect a not so smart question is one where someone has an issue and decides to ask about it rather than spend the time to first look for a solution themselves [1].
