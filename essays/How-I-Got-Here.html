  <h2 id="how-i-got-here">How I got Here</h2>

<p>Probably like most other students choosing to get their degrees in Computer Engineering or Computer Science started out playing video games. I for one started to find my passion for the tech industry this way. Somewhere along the way in hours of playing whatever it is I’m hooked on I decided that I wanted to go to school and learn to program and learn how to build devices like game consoles or other types of circuits. I got interested in how our electronics operated, so I asked google questions like, how do touchscreens work on smartphones, how do you develop a video game, and what are circuits made from. I knew I wanted to do something where I can say I worked on something that benefits or helps someone in a positive way. I also looked up how much do you get paid to develop and design the products we use every day. So that’s how I choose to get a degree in computer engineering.</p>

<p>So, computer engineering is half electrical engineering and computer science. So, to stick to the computer science side, what interest me most about software engineering is that I could make something that is helpful to others. Another thing is the process of going through the steps in designing, developing, testing, and maintaining/improving a program sounds fun and presents challenges that improves me as a developer/engineer.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-see-my-future">How I see my Future</h2>

<p>In the future I hope to develop my skills in programming by writing code in the best efficient way. I also hope to continue improving my communication skills with teammates/co-workers and ask the right questions when I don’t know something. I also how to improve my knowledge with what programming languages I should be using based on the application I’m trying to work on and become p[proficient in the languages I already know.</p>
