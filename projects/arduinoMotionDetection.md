  The idea behind this project started out with finding a way to make sure firefighters are leaving the station within the 2 minute timeframe they are told they have once they recive the dispatch alarm for an incident. Currently there is already a tracking system in place on the trucks but the issue with that is their locations are updated on a timer rather than if they were driving. So the solution we came up with was to use and accelerometer hooked to an Arduino that sent a signal to the COM port on the laptop. So after coming up with this idea I was tasked to create the device and program it do what we wanted and create the automated program that collected the data produced.
